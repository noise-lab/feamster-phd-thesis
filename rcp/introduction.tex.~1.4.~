%%%% WHAT IS OUR POSITION?
We posit that interdomain routing protocol
functionality should be separated from the routers.  Stated somewhat glibly,
routing is too important and too complicated to be
left to today's routers!  IP ``routers'' should be
``lookup-and-forward'' switches, forwarding packets as rapidly as
possible without being concerned about path selection.  
A separate entity should be responsible for 
computing the best BGP paths on behalf 
of all the routers in a domain and disseminating the results to the
routers. 

%Routers should forward packets but should not be
%concerned with distributed path computation.  Rather, a single
%logically centralized entity should perform all route computation on
%behalf of the routers in a routing domain.


%%%% This para should say WHY we believe in our position (motivation)

Separating interdomain routing from the individual routers is one way to
cope with the increasing complexity of the routing system.
The growth of the Internet has introduced considerable complexity into
interdomain routing, as  
features have been added to BGP to support
more flexibility (\eg, new route attributes such as communities and
MED) and larger scale (\eg, route reflectors and route aggregation).
This complexity has made routing protocol
behavior increasingly unpredictable and error prone~\cite{Feamster2004h}.
Requiring the 
routers to perform complex path computation introduces the potential
for inconsistencies across routers, complicates the expression of
routing policy, and makes troubleshooting difficult.


%%%
%%% Ossification
%%%
%% Placing policies and low-level features in routers makes the interdomain
%% routing system resistant to change.  Most research either analyzes the
%% problems with the routing system or proposes solutions that work within
%% (or around) the limitations of BGP.  Arguably, the growing research
%% interest in overlay networks reflects the community's general
%% frustration with the difficulty of effecting real, substantive change in
%% the Internet's underlying routing system.  However, fixing the routing
%% system is an important and challenging goal that the networking research
%% community needs to address.

%%% Enabling 
%%%
Instead, a separate {\em Routing Control Platform (RCP)} should have
the information needed to select routes for each router in a domain
(\eg, an AS) and exchange routing information with RCPs in other
domains.\footnote{We use the term ``RCP'' to refer to
both the architecture as a whole and to the specific instance of RCP
within a routing domain.}
Figure~\ref{fig:interas} illustrates this idea.
%The RCP exchanges routing information with other ASes and sends each
%router in the AS a route to use in constructing its local forwarding
%table.  
Each RCP could use a new way of selecting routes for each router
(rather than using today's unwieldy BGP decision process); RCPs 
could even exchange routes using an interdomain routing protocol other
than BGP.  By selecting routes on behalf of {\em all\/} routers in a
domain, RCP can avoid many internal BGP-related complications (\eg,
forwarding loops~\cite{Dube99} and signaling partitions~\cite{Feamster2004h}).
%
%We believe that separating interdomain routing functionality from
%individual routers will reduce the complexity of routing configuration
%and management.  
%In this paper, we will
%describe how a logically centralized 
This approach also facilitates traffic engineering, simpler and less
error-prone policy expression, more powerful diagnosis and
troubleshooting, more rapid deployment of protocol modifications and
features, enforceable consistency of routes, and verifiable
correctness properties.  
%
In contrast to previous approaches for centralizing interdomain routes
and policies at route servers~\cite{Govindan1998}, RCP also preserves
the autonomy of each AS for selecting paths and applying
policies.\footnote{RCP more closely resembles the
Network Control Point (NCP), introduced in the telephone network in the
early 1980s to simplify network management and support the rapid
introduction of new features (\eg, enhanced 1-800 service)~\cite{Horing82,Lawser82}.}

RCP's deployment path is as interesting
as the envisioned end state.  The deployment of RCP can proceed in
three stages, offering the following benefits to network operators as
RCP becomes more widely deployed:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=-1pt
\item \textbf{Control over protocol interactions:} RCP customizes the
distribution of BGP routes within an AS by replacing internal BGP route
reflectors.  This stage does not require cooperation from
neighboring domains.  Because RCP has a complete view of the intra-AS
topology and selects routes on behalf of all routers in the domain, it
can prevent internal BGP routing anomalies and control 
traffic flow more directly.

\item \textbf{Network-wide path selection and policy:} By establishing
BGP sessions
directly with the routers in neighboring ASes, RCP can perform all
routing decisions for an AS, bypassing the BGP decision
process on the routers.  This approach simplifies configuration and allows an
AS to select routes based on high-level goals, rather than obscure
manipulation of BGP route attributes.

\item \textbf{Redefinition of inter-AS routing:} Using RCPs, rather than
routers, to exchange routes between ASes (as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:interas}) enables the design of a new routing protocol
because interdomain routing is now separated from IP routers.  For
example, RCP can be used to implement a control overlay that selects
paths based on prices or performance statistics.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
%% Each phase reduces management complexity
%% fosters innovation and is completely backwards compatible with existing
%% routers. 


In addition to providing substantial improvements over today's routing
architecture, RCP has a compelling deployment incentive (\ie, a
``tipping point''), so that an individual AS could deploy RCP and
still realize significant benefits.  Because the first two stages of
deployment substantially reduce management complexity for BGP routing
{\em within a single AS\/}, network operators have a compelling
incentive to deploy RCP regardless of whether other ASes do so.
%Many innovative ideas (\eg, QoS, multicast, IPv6) have not yet
%been widely deployed operational networks because deploying these
%services provides no return until other ASes also do so.
%We believe that effecting real change in
%the Internet routing architecture requires a ``tipping point''---a
%compelling incentive for an AS to migrate to a new approach
%independently of other ASes.
%%%
%%% Tipping point
%%%
%Routing within a large backbone network depends on external BGP (eBGP)
%to exchange routes with other ASes, internal BGP (iBGP) to propagate
%these routes inside the AS, and the IGP to select paths between the
%routers in the AS.
Managing routing configuration requires constant vigilance from
network operators.  Although network management systems can often
automate the most frequent tasks, working around and within the
constraints of the existing routing protocols makes these systems much
more complicated than necessary.  Additionally, the complexity of
modeling and managing the distributed configuration state in today's
routers has itself impeded the evolution of automated management
systems.  
%Simplifying the management of a single network provides an
%incentive for an AS to deploy RCP independently of other ASes.
%%%
%%% As few changes as possible
%%%
In addition, because it communicates routes to each router in the
AS using BGP, RCP is backwards compatible with existing routers; deploying
RCP requires no changes to router hardware and software, only to
router {\em configuration}.
%Fortunately, BGP's relatively simple message format makes it easier to design
%RCP to be backwards compatible with functionality on existing routers.
%RCP uses BGP to communicate routes to each router in the AS.
%
%Arguably, this separation
%facilitated the unfortunate addition of numerous complex features in
%router implementations over the past fifteen years.  Fortunately, the
%protocol's simplicity is also a powerful enabler for change in
%how BGP is used in operational networks, without sacrificing
%backwards-compatibility with the protocol specification and existing
%routers.

The rest of the section proceeds as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:backg} presents background
on today's interdomain routing infrastructure.  In
Section~\ref{sec:principles}, we propose three architectural principles
and explain how the existing routing infrastructure fails to meet them.
Building on these insights, Section~\ref{sec:arch} describes the RCP
architecture in detail, focusing on how each stage of deployment
simplifies router configuration and management.  
%By using BGP to communicate routes to each router in the AS,
%the RCP is  backwards-compatible with existing routers.
%To simplify the discussion, we initially assume that the RCP in 
%each AS is a physically-centralized server.  
In Section~\ref{sec:weaknesses}, we discuss the risks and challenges
of having the RCP in the critical path of IP routing decisions.
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.


%BGP is a path-vector protocol that operates at the level of
%destination prefixes (blocks of IP addresses).  A BGP-speaking router
%sends an advertisement to notify its neighbor of a new route to the
%destination prefix and a withdrawal to revoke the route when it is no
%longer available.  Each advertisement includes various attributes,
%such as the list of the ASes in the path (the {\em AS path\/}) and the
%IP address of the router responsible for the route (the {\em next
%hop}).  Upon receiving a new route, the router applies a configurable
%{\em import\/} policy that may discard the route or modify its
%attributes to influence the path selection process.  The router
%executes a decision process that compares the BGP routes (for the same
%destination prefix) to select a single best route.  {\em Export\/}
%policies determine whether (and how) the router propagates the best
%route to its BGP neighbors.  

%%%
%%% Migration plan -- phase 1
%%% 
%To convince an AS to deploy an RCP, we must make existing network
%management tasks easier and enable valuable new functionality, without
%requiring cooperation from neighboring domains or any changes to the
%existing routers.  In the first phase, we envision that the RCP has an
%iBGP session with each router in an AS to learn BGP routes and send
%each router a customized routing choice.  This would significantly
%reduce the iBGP configuration complexity by obviating the need to use
%route reflectors to distribute BGP-learned routes throughout a large
%AS.  Instead, the RCP can send each router the route that router would
%have picked with all of the options at its disposal.  This avoids the
%kinds of protocol oscillations, packet deflections, and forwarding
%loops that can easily arise when route reflectors are used.  In
%addition, operators can use the RCP to override the common use of the
%IGP in ``hot potato'' routing.  Exerting direct control over the
%selection of the egress point for each router can prevent unintended
%shifts in traffic during network maintenance, or allow intentional
%shifts for the purpose of traffic engineering.  In addition, the RCP
%can use traffic and performance measurements to adapt the behavior
%of the network to service level agreements.

%%%
%%% Migration plan -- phase 2
%%%
%Despite the many benefits of controlling the selection of egress
%points, the routing decisions in the first phase would still depend on
%the BGP policies applied to eBGP routes learned at the border routers.
%In the second phase, the RCP receives all of the eBGP routes from
%neighboring domains.  This effectively disables the BGP decision
%process at each router and places the sole responsibility for applying
%BGP policies and selecting BGP paths with the RCP.  This enables the
%RCP to select paths directly based on higher-level engineering goals,
%rather than by a complex manipulation of the attributes of individual
%BGP routes.  For example, the RCP could easily move part of the
%traffic to new paths to balance load in the network.  Or, the RCP
%could apply its own route flap damping algorithm to the full set of
%eBGP-learned routes to select stable paths for the routers.  The RCP
%could also perform local route aggregation to send a compressed BGP
%routing table to each router in the domain, which would help reduce
%the size of the BGP routing table on the operational routers.
%Finally, the RCP could also serve as a (logically) central place to
%check the validity and consistency of the BGP routes sent by
%neighboring domains to improve the security of the routing system.

%%%
%%% Migration plane -- phase 3
%%%
%In the first two phases, BGP still serves as the primary way the RCP
%learns routes from neighboring domains.  As such, the RCP still has
%limited influence on the routing choices advertised by its neighbors.
%In the third phase, the RCP in different ASes communicate directly, as
%shown in Figure~\ref{fig:interas}.  In the simplest scenario, the ASes
%managed by the same institution can coordinate their routing decisions
%through their RCPs.  More generally, any set of ASes could use their
%RCPs to exchange routing information.  Although eBGP may be used for
%inter-RCP communication, different protocols could be designed and
%deployed that offer more natural ways for competing ASes to advertise
%and select paths.  For example, the RCPs could form an overlay network
%for publishing and storing possible routes.  New protocols could
%evolve that associate prices or performance statistics with the routes
%to make the economic incentives underlying interdomain routing more
%explicit.  In this final phase, the BGP protocol exists only to allow
%an RCP to send customized routing decisions to the installed base of
%legacy routers inside the AS.  Eventually, as future routers are
%built, new protocols could support the ``pushing'' of routes from 
%the RCP to the routers.

%%% Complexity -- we're removing this: comes out later at various
%%% places in the paper
%%%
%% Over the past 15 years, the Internet's interdomain routing system
%% has become increasingly difficult to manage and resistant to
%% fundamental innovation.  The complexity of managing interdomain
%% routing arises because the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) must glue
%% together tens of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) with disparate
%% (and sometimes conflicting) policy goals.  The large scale and high
%% configurability result in a global routing system that converges
%% slowly~\cite{labovitz:ton01} and may not converge at
%% all~\cite{Griffin2002c}.  Similar routing problems can occur inside an
%% AS, leading to protocol oscillation and even persistent forwarding
%% loops~\cite{Griffin2002}, as well as abrupt reactions to small changes
%% in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)~\cite{teixeira2004b}.  Adjusting
%% the flow of traffic requires complex changes to BGP policies on
%% individual routers~\cite{Feamster2003e}, 
%% and the effects are hard to predict
%% in advance~\cite{Feamster2004}.  The wealth of low-level features in BGP
%% implementations makes router configuration difficult and error prone,
%% leading to frequent mistakes that have global
%% consequences~\cite{feamster03:verify,mahajan:02}.
