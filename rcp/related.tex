Scaling problems exist not only within a single AS, but also between
groups of ASes.  The route arbiter project proposed placing route
servers at exchange points~\cite{Govindan1998} to obviate the need for a
full mesh eBGP topology (\ie, at the exchange point) by applying policy
once at the route server.  This architecture facilitates centralized
application of BGP routing policies at a single exchange point.  In
Section~\ref{sec:rcp}, we present RCP, which primarily addresses how to
scalably disseminate routes {\em within} a single AS.  In some ways, RCP
can be viewed as an analog to route servers~\cite{Govindan1998} for
intra-AS route dissemination: whereas route servers were used to reduce
the number of eBGP sessions from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the
number of ASes at an exchange point, RCP reduces the number of iBGP
sessions from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of routers in
a single AS.  Because RCP separates the logic of route selection from
the physical routers, it is conceivable that it could also used as a
platform for developing new mechanisms for exchanging routes between
pairs or groups of routers.
